1868 East India Pale Ale
(5 gallons/19 L, all-grain)
OG = 1.067 FG = 1.015
IBU = 100+ SRM = 6 ABV = 7.1%

Ingredients
14 lbs. (6.4 kg) Maris Otter pale ale malt

51 AAU UK Goldings hops (90 min.) (10.25 oz./0.29 kg at 5% alpha acids)

3 oz. (85 g) UK Goldings hops (dry hop)

White Labs WLP017 (Whitbread Ale) or Wyeast 1099 (Whitbread Ale) or Safale S-04 yeast

2⁄3 cup corn sugar (if priming)


Step by Step

Mash grains with hot water (1.2 qts./lb.) at 150–152 °F (66–67 °C) for 1 hour. 
\Run off and sparge to collect about 6 gallons (23 L) of wort. 
Bring to a boil and add the bittering hops, boil 90 minutes. 
Cool to 65–70 °F (18–21 °C) and pitch with yeast, preferably two packs prepared previously as two 1-qt. 
(1-L) starters. Ferment 5 days, rack to secondary and add the dry hops in a sanitized weighted muslin bag. 
After 1–2 weeks rack to keg or bottle and prime or carbonate in the usual way.

*This is a lot of hops, which will likely result in loss of wort in the residue when racked.
I have used Goldings for this to follow the original as closely as possible. 
However, it is more practical to replace these with 29 AAU Progress hops (3.6 oz./102 g at 8% alpha acids).
