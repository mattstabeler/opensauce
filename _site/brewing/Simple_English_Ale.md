# English Ale

Recipe is for 10L brew

Ingredients

```
10L Water
Pale: 1kg
Wheat: 125g
Crystal: 20g
Golding Hops: 65g
Irish Moss: 1tsp
Yeast: â€œthe blue one" - Safale S-04
```


# Hops

```
60: 15g
15: 20g & Irish moss
10: 20g
5: 10g
```


If you want to boost the hoppiness, mix in 5g of chinook at 15m/10m/5m 

If you want to boost the sweetness and make it more full bodied boost the crystal. This will add an orangey colour, but will make it awesome. 60g for example

The wheat is mostly to give some body, and a good head. Typically you want 10% of the pale as wheat for body/head
