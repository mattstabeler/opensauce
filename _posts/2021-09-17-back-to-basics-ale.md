# Back to basics with an English Ale

With the help of Ethan, AKA "brew boy" we went back to basics.

After a long run of bad batches, I threw away all my old hops and malt, bought some fresh, and made a brew with my first ever recipe.

```
1500g Maris Otter Pale Malt
80g Crystal Malt
80g Crushed Wheat Malt

12L Water

60m 20g Goldings
15m 20g Goldings + 5g Chinook
10m 20g Goldings + 5g Chinook
5m 10g Goldings + 5g Chinook

Safale S-04 (blue) yeast

OG: 1.042
```


Hoping that this time, we avoid the bad flavours of the last few batches... :)
