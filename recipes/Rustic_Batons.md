# Ingredients 
_to make 2_

- ~490g strong bread flour (white works best)
- 375ml hand-warm water
- 1/4 tsp dry bread yeast

Optional: 
- replace up to ~20% of the water with milk or yoghurt. (makes it softer I think, but too much makes it soggy)
- add 1 tbsp olive oil to the water
- add 1-2 tsp of honey to the water
- replace yeast with maybe 50g of sourdough starter (I found this make it a bit more flat - over-proofed - than yeast, but better flavour )


# Method


- Mix dry ingredients in a bowl
- Add the wet ingredients
- Mix well, until all the flour is part of the dough
- Cover with cling film, and/or a damp tea-towel, and leave in a warm spot for 8-12 hours

It should be very bubbly and have at least doubled in size, if not tripled. 



## Baking

Prep a baking rack or tray with a non-stick baking sheet, pre-heat oven to 220C

- Turn out well-risen dough onto a well floured surface.
- form into a rough loaf shape
- cut in half along the lengh and separate into to equal sized (_sprinkle with flour on top to stop knife sticking_)
- one by one, flip over (to get more flour on) and immediately transfer to the baking rack, shaping to a rough baton shape
- optonally: score along the length or at 45 degree angles (i found that scoring works best after a few minutes in the oven)
- Bake for 25 mins
- allow to cool so the moisture creates a crunchy crust
