Swapped El-Dorado for Amarillo pellets,
Swapped Yeast for S-04


## Water
Add 7.9 gallons (29.9 liters) of water into the kettle. If you're not sure how to do this, here's an article on brewing water chemistry to get you started.

## Grains
This grain bill is pretty simple and is much like the rest of our hazy IPA recipes. One note, we used a pound of corn because we were out of rye. So, you may want to consider swapping the two.

Pale malt (2 row) - 6 lbs, 8.0 oz. (2kg 948.4g)
Flaked oats - 1 lb. (453.6g)
Flaked wheat - 1 lb. (453.6g)
Flaked corn - 1 lb. (453.6g)
all grains weighed out in bowls on table


## Mash
We did a single step mash at 152 degrees Fahrenheit (66.7C) for 60 minutes and did not sparge. Yes, you read that right. No sparge. It's how we do. Don't knock it until you try it. Also, if you do try it, put a fine crush on your grains to boost efficiency.

## Hops, etc
We used the following hops at the amounts and times listed during a 75-minute boil.

El Dorado - 1 oz (28.35g) at 75 minutes
El Dorado - 2 oz (56.7g) at flame out

Suggested modifications to the hop schedule: You may want to dry hop with an additional ounce a few days into fermentation. The aroma faded pretty fast on this beer. El Dorado is billed as a "dual purpose" hop, meaning that it can be used for aroma and bittering, but it's better at bittering in our opinion.

Yeast and Fermentation
This beer was fermented with 200 billion cells (1 package) of Imperial Yeast's "Dry Hop" blend.

This yeast produces a juicy, fruity taste and also accentuates the hops that are added. We kept this one at a steady 65F (18.3C) for the entire fermentation period.

## Benchmarks
Post boil water volume was 5.3 gallons (20.1 liters) (add water to match if you're low)
Starting gravity was 1.052
Ending Gravity was 1.010
ABV is 5.5%
Estimated IBUs: 58
