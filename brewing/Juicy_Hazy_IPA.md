# Matt's Hazy NEIPA


This is adapted from a recipe I [found online](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/top-few-hops-for-juicy-hazy-neipa.675188/) where I have changed El-Dorado hops to Amarillo, and swapped to use S-04 yeast. Also, where they have used extra pale malt, this uses the maris otter I already have. 

### Malts

- 1480g - Pale malt - Maris Otter
- 225g - flaked oats
- 225g - flaked wheat
- 225g - rye malt

### Mash

15L Water
60 minutes at ~70C


### Hops

T90 Amarillo pellets - 8.5%

- 60m - 15g 
- 00m - 30g 

- Dry Hop - 15g

### Yeast

S-04













# Hazy NEIPA
from: https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/top-few-hops-for-juicy-hazy-neipa.675188/
Swapped El-Dorado for Amarillo pellets,
Swapped Yeast for S-04


## Water
Add 7.9 gallons (29.9 liters) of water into the kettle. 


## Grains
This grain bill is pretty simple and is much like the rest of our hazy IPA recipes. One note, we used a pound of corn because we were out of rye. So, you may want to consider swapping the two.

- Pale malt (2 row) - 6 lbs, 8.0 oz. (2kg 948.4g)
- Flaked oats - 1 lb. (453.6g)
- Flaked wheat - 1 lb. (453.6g)
- Flaked corn - 1 lb. (453.6g)

all grains weighed out in bowls on table


## Mash
We did a single step mash at 152 degrees Fahrenheit (66.7C) for 60 minutes and did not sparge. Yes, you read that right. No sparge. It's how we do. Don't knock it until you try it. Also, if you do try it, put a fine crush on your grains to boost efficiency.

## Hops, etc
We used the following hops at the amounts and times listed during a 75-minute boil.

- El Dorado - 1 oz (28.35g) at 75 minutes
- El Dorado - 2 oz (56.7g) at flame out

Suggested modifications to the hop schedule: You may want to dry hop with an additional ounce a few days into fermentation. The aroma faded pretty fast on this beer. 

El Dorado is billed as a "dual purpose" hop, meaning that it can be used for aroma and bittering, but it's better at bittering in our opinion.


## Yeast and Fermentation

This beer was fermented with 200 billion cells (1 package) of Imperial Yeast's "Dry Hop" blend.

This yeast produces a juicy, fruity taste and also accentuates the hops that are added. We kept this one at a steady 65F (18.3C) for the entire fermentation period.

## Benchmarks

- Post boil water volume was 5.3 gallons (20.1 liters) (add water to match if you're low)
- Starting gravity was 1.052
- Ending Gravity was 1.010
- ABV is 5.5%
- Estimated IBUs: 58
